INTRODUCTION — Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is an inflammatory
disorder characterized by quotidian (daily) fevers, arthritis, and an evanescent
rash. The disease can have a monophasic, intermittent, or chronic course.


Following its initial description in children by George Still in 1896, "Still's disease"
became the eponymous term for all childhood-onset arthritis, subsequently
restricted to the febrile form now termed systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis
(sJIA) [1,2]. In 1971, Bywaters described a series of adult patients with a
syndrome that closely resembled sJIA [3]. "Adult-onset Still's disease" is now the
most widely used term for the condition when it begins after the patient's 16th
birthday. AOSD and sJIA are increasingly recognized as belonging to the same
clinical continuum [4]. (See "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical
manifestations and diagnosis".)


The treatment and prognosis of AOSD will be reviewed here. The clinical
manifestations and diagnosis of AOSD and the treatment of sJIA are presented
separately. (See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult-onset Still's
disease" and "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment".)


GOALS OF THERAPY — The goals of therapy include:
    ●  Control of the physical signs and symptoms of inflammation (eg, fever, rash,
       morning stiffness, joint pain, and swelling) and, secondarily, control of
       laboratory indices of inflammation (eg, elevations in the erythrocyte
       sedimentation rate [ESR] and levels of C-reactive protein [CRP]). (See
       "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease", section
       on 'Clinical presentation'.)


    ●  Prompt recognition and treatment of a hyperinflammatory complication of
       adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) termed macrophage activation syndrome
       (MAS). (See "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and
---
      complications", section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome' and "Systemic
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment", section on 'Macrophage activation
      syndrome' and "Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic
      lymphohistiocytosis" and "Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic
      lymphohistiocytosis", section on 'MAS/Rheumatologic conditions' and
      "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment".)


      Initiation of many treatments has been associated temporally with the
      appearance or worsening of MAS [5-9]. Such reports may simply reflect
      inadequate treatment of subclinical MAS but highlight the need for close
      observation of patients with AOSD beginning treatment, including screening
      laboratory tests for MAS within two weeks of any substantial changes in
      therapy. (See 'Monitoring for MAS' below.)
   ●  Prevention of end-organ damage, including joint injury and other major
      organ complications. (See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult-
      onset Still's disease", section on 'Clinical presentation'.)
   ●  Minimization of the risk of adverse effects of therapy, including long-term
      effects of glucocorticoids. (See "Major adverse effects of systemic
      glucocorticoids".)


PRETREATMENT EVALUATION AND PREVENTION OF ADVERSE DRUG
EFFECTS
   ●  Confirmation of the diagnosis – It is important to exclude other systemic
      conditions that may present with symptoms similar to adult-onset Still's
      disease (AOSD), such as infection and malignancy, before initiating
      immunosuppressive therapies. Where uncertainty remains, initiation of
      treatment with an interleukin (IL) 1 antagonist rather than glucocorticoids
      can provide important diagnostic information (see 'Anakinra: Efficacy and
      rationale' below). The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of AOSD are
      described in detail separately. (See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of
      adult-onset Still's disease".)
   ●  Pretreatment testing – The baseline testing, screening, and preventive
      interventions generally performed prior to initiating therapy with any
      nonbiologic, targeted synthetic (small molecule), or biologic disease-
      modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), and glucocorticoids are generally
      the same as those used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA); these are described in
      detail separately (see "General principles and overview of management of
      rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Pretreatment evaluation' and
      "Interleukin 1 inhibitors: Biology, principles of use, and adverse events",
      section on 'Pretreatment testing'). Briefly, these include:
       •  General testing for all patients – Baseline complete blood count
          (CBC), serum creatinine, aminotransferases, erythrocyte sedimentation
          rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). In patients receiving IL-6
          inhibitors and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, lipids are also monitored. In
          AOSD, to assess for the presence of macrophage activation syndrome
          (MAS), we also assess ferritin and D-dimer.
---
       •  Hepatitis virus screening – In all patients without serologically
          confirmed hepatitis, we screen for hepatitis B and C before initiating
          therapy with conventional DMARDs, including methotrexate (MTX) and
          leflunomide (LEF); biologic DMARDs; and JAK inhibitors.


       •  Testing for latent tuberculosis – We screen for latent tuberculosis
          (TB) with an interferon-gamma release assay or with skin testing prior to
          all biologic DMARDs and prior to use of a JAK inhibitor.


          We obtain a chest radiograph in patients with a history of other risk
          factors for latent TB, even if screening tests are negative, given the risks
          of false-negative testing. Additionally, screening should be repeated in
          patients with new TB exposures. Glucocorticoids and other factors may
          cause false-negative results. Screening for latent TB is discussed in detail
          separately. (See "Risk of mycobacterial infection associated with biologic
          agents and JAK inhibitors" and "Tuberculosis infection (latent
          tuberculosis) in adults: Approach to diagnosis (screening)".)


      It is not always necessary to await completion of screening for latent TB
      before beginning short-term IL-1 inhibition with anakinra, particularly when
      it is urgent to initiate such treatment since IL-1 inhibition does not pose a
      demonstrated risk for TB reactivation. (See 'Approach to initial therapy'
      below and "Interleukin 1 inhibitors: Biology, principles of use, and adverse
      events", section on 'Infection'.)
   ●  Immunization – The approach to immunization is generally the same as in
      patients with RA and other autoimmune rheumatic diseases. To the extent
      possible, patients should receive vaccines at appropriate intervals prior to
      the start of immunosuppressive drug therapy, although this may not always
      be feasible. Vaccines should not be given until febrile episodes are
      controlled. Immunization in patients with rheumatic diseases is described in
      detail separately. (See "Immunizations in autoimmune inflammatory
      rheumatic disease in adults".)
   ●  Antibiotic prophylaxis – There is uncertainty regarding which patients
      with AOSD, based upon their respective treatment regimens and medication
      doses, are likely to benefit from the additional use of prophylactic antibiotics
      to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia. Generally, patients being treated with
      prednisone (or equivalent) in a dose of at least 20 mg daily for greater than
      a month, especially if in combination with another immunosuppressive
      medication, are among those most likely to benefit from prophylactic
      treatment. (See "Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in
      patients without HIV", section on 'Indications' and "Treatment and
      prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients without HIV", section on
      'Regimens'.)


INITIAL THERAPY: NEW-ONSET DISEASE


Approach to initial therapy — Therapeutic decisions in newly diagnosed adult-
onset Still’s disease (AOSD) are based upon whether macrophage activation
syndrome (MAS), a "cytokine storm" that can be life threatening, is present or
---
suspected, and by the severity of disease; it may be influenced by whether
systemic or arthritic features are predominant. During periods of active systemic
disease, patients are at highest risk of developing MAS. (See "Clinical
manifestations and diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease".)


Arthritis may be evident early in disease or appear subsequently and often
persists after systemic symptoms have resolved. In new-onset disease, severe or
highly symptomatic arthritis can be an important target of therapy. Treatment of
established AOSD may differ from new-onset disease. (See 'Subsequent therapy:
Established disease' below.)


We address the following clinical questions before starting therapy:
   ●  Is MAS present? – The first priority in new-onset AOSD is to exclude
      incipient or active MAS requiring immediate intervention. Criteria developed
      for the diagnosis of MAS in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) [10]
      have been applied but not extensively tested in patients with AOSD [11].
      The diagnosis of MAS in AOSD and in sJIA is described in detail separately.
      (See 'Concern for incipient or active MAS' below and 'Monitoring for MAS'
      below and "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult-onset Still's
      disease", section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome' and "Systemic
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and complications", section
      on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'.)


      The treatment of MAS, including in patients with rheumatic disease such as
      AOSD, is also described separately. (See "Treatment and prognosis of
      hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", section on 'MAS/Rheumatologic
      conditions'.)


      The management of AOSD in patients with a high degree of suspicion of
      concomitant or incipient MAS frequently involves the use of combination
      therapy with a biologic, such as anakinra, together with glucocorticoids.
      (See 'Concern for incipient or active MAS' below.)


   ●  Is disease mild to moderate or moderate to severe? – For patients
      without evidence of active or incipient MAS, a distinction should be made
      between patients with mild or mild to moderate disease, who may initially be
      treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and patients
      with moderate to severe disease, who require treatment with a biologic
      agent, usually anakinra or another interleukin (IL) 1 inhibitor,
      glucocorticoids, or combination therapy. (See 'Mild to moderate disease'
      below and 'Moderate to severe disease' below.)


       •  Mild to moderate – Mild to moderate disease at disease onset is
          characterized by nondisabling fever, rash, arthralgias or mild arthritis,
          and the absence of MAS.
       •  Moderate to severe – Moderate to severe disease may be defined by
          the additional presence of clinically significant serositis (eg, pleurisy or
          peritonitis), moderate to severe and debilitating polyarthritis, persistent
          high fevers despite treatment with NSAIDs, or internal organ
          involvement. (See "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of adult-onset
---
          Still's disease", section on 'Clinical presentation'.)


There are no reliable prognostic criteria in new-onset AOSD to discriminate
patients who will have a mild, self-limited course from those who will have a
more severe chronic course [12]. For this reason, we do not base our decision to
use or withhold biologic therapy on particular clinical features at presentation,
and generally initiate a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) if
symptoms are not completely controlled after two weeks of NSAIDs. In patients
with severe or highly symptomatic disease, we frequently begin biologic therapy
as soon as possible, beginning with a combination of biologics and glucocorticoids
if incipient or early MAS is suspected.


Direct evidence regarding the efficacy of different treatment strategies for new-
onset AOSD is derived from observational case series and from clinical
experience, both in AOSD and in sJIA.


Mild to moderate disease — For patients suspected of new-onset AOSD with
no more than mild to moderate symptoms (see 'Approach to initial therapy'
above), and in the absence of MAS, we suggest initial management with NSAIDs
alone, rather than glucocorticoids, DMARDs, or biologics, especially while
evaluation for alternate causes of fever (eg, infection or lymphoma) is ongoing.
An antiinflammatory dose and regimen of NSAIDs should be used; typical choices
include naproxen (500 mg twice daily), ibuprofen (800 mg three times daily), and
indomethacin (25 to 50 mg three times daily). There is no evidence that any one
NSAID has greater efficacy for AOSD than another.


Up to 20 percent of patients achieve control of the signs and symptoms of mild
AOSD with NSAIDs [3,5,13-15]. However, NSAIDs are often insufficient, and in
many patients, fevers, rash, and joint symptoms become or remain intolerable
despite the use of NSAIDs or more severe features develop necessitating
additional intervention. The approach for patients who have not responded
sufficiently to a 7- to 14-day trial of an NSAID alone during the acute phase of
the illness is similar to that for patients who present with moderate to severe
disease. (See 'Moderate to severe disease' below.)


Most patients in whom NSAIDs alone are inadequate to control symptoms should
discontinue NSAIDs as soon as possible after they are switched to
glucocorticoids. Patients receiving NSAIDs together with glucocorticoids should
receive prophylactic therapy for the prevention of NSAID gastropathy. (See
"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity".)


The adverse effects of NSAIDs are generally the same as in other conditions and
are described in detail separately (see "Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of
adverse effects" and "Overview of COX-2 selective NSAIDs", section on 'Toxicities
and possible toxicities'). Underlying cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk
factors should be considered during NSAID initiation but are not absolute
contraindications as there are limited effective options for initial AOSD therapy.
(See "NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects" and "NSAIDs (including aspirin):
Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity" and "NSAIDs (including aspirin):
Treatment and secondary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity".)
---
Salicylates, historically a mainstay of therapy for sJIA, are now seldom used to
treat either AOSD or sJIA because their therapeutic index is narrower than that of
most nonsalicylate NSAIDs.


In patients unable to tolerate NSAIDs, glucocorticoids in low to moderate doses
(eg, prednisone 10 to 30 mg orally once daily or equivalent) can be an effective
alternative. However, since glucocorticoid monotherapy tends to become
prolonged, we prefer in such cases to advance rapidly to a biologic DMARD, in
order to discontinue glucocorticoids within two months. For patients primarily
with arthritis rather than systemic symptoms, methotrexate (MTX) is a
reasonable alternative to a biologic DMARD as the initial glucocorticoid-sparing
agent. (See 'Glucocorticoid-sparing therapy for chronic management' below.)


Moderate to severe disease


   Treatment approach — For patients with new-onset moderate to severe
AOSD and those with milder disease in whom NSAIDs are inadequate, we prefer
to initiate therapy with anakinra. Glucocorticoids are a reasonable alternative but
have some comparative disadvantages in this setting. (See 'Anakinra: Efficacy
and rationale' below and 'Glucocorticoids: Efficacy and rationale' below.)
   ●  Anakinra – For management of new-onset moderate to severe AOSD (see
      'Approach to initial therapy' above) and for patients in whom two weeks of
      NSAIDs are insufficient (see 'Mild to moderate disease' above), we suggest
      anakinra rather than continued NSAIDs alone, glucocorticoids, or another
      DMARD (such as biologics and conventional synthetic DMARDs). Our usual
      initial dose is 100 mg subcutaneously daily. For patients in whom a partial
      response is observed after 7 to 14 days, the dose can be increased to 100
      mg twice daily. (See 'Anakinra: Efficacy and rationale' below.)


      For patients who have attained remission, spacing of anakinra injections to
      every other day and then every third day provides an opportunity to test
      whether the underlying disease is truly in remission, facilitating
      discontinuation of therapy. The duration of remission required to optimize
      the probability of sustained remission is unknown; a three-month period of
      remission is reasonable [16].


      Given greater concerns about exacerbating bacterial infections with IL-6
      blockade than with IL-1 blockade, and the much longer half-lives of the IL-6
      inhibitors tocilizumab or sarilumab (approximately 8 to 14 days) than
      anakinra (six hours), we prefer anakinra in this setting and typically do not
      employ tocilizumab or sarilumab in new-onset disease where diagnostic
      uncertainty remains, as is often the case.


   ●  Glucocorticoids – Glucocorticoids are a reasonable alternative to anakinra,
      particularly for patients unable to obtain anakinra. Initial doses of
      prednisone for AOSD range from 20 to 60 mg orally daily, depending upon
      an individualized assessment of the severity of disease and the rapidity of
      the initial response to therapy. (See 'Glucocorticoids: Efficacy and rationale'
      below.)


      Oral glucocorticoids treat both systemic and arthritic features of AOSD.
---
      Patients usually respond to glucocorticoids within hours to a few days, but a
      longer period of therapy may be required in some patients [5,14].
      Approximately 70 percent of patients respond to glucocorticoids alone or to
      glucocorticoids used after a trial of NSAIDs [13,17].


      Some patients with monoarthritis or oligoarthritis and those with very severe
      or refractory disease may benefit from intraarticular or intravenous
      glucocorticoid administration, respectively:
       •  Intraarticular glucocorticoids – Patients with one or two inflamed joints
          despite use of systemic medications may benefit from intraarticular
          glucocorticoid injections. In such cases, consideration should always be
          given to the possibility of an alternate cause of arthritis, such as bacterial
          infection or Lyme disease, which may be assessed by additional studies
          such as synovial fluid Gram stain and culture and Lyme serology,
          respectively. (See "Use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of rheumatoid
          arthritis", section on 'Intraarticular therapy' and "Musculoskeletal
          manifestations of Lyme disease" and "Septic arthritis in adults" and
          "Diagnosis of Lyme disease".)
       •  Intravenous glucocorticoids – Pulse intravenous methylprednisolone,
          1000 mg daily for one to three days, is typically reserved for patients
          with MAS but represents an option for patients with otherwise refractory
          systemic or arthritic disease [18,19].


      Once control of symptoms is achieved for at least two weeks and laboratory
      indices have normalized, glucocorticoids are tapered rapidly to a low-
      maintenance dose for two to three months to maintain control of signs and
      symptoms of disease. As an example, in a patient initially receiving 60 mg of
      prednisone daily, we may decrease the daily dose of glucocorticoids every
      week with the aim of reducing prednisone dosing to below 10 mg daily
      within eight weeks, then discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy over the
      subsequent three months. Since only a relatively small proportion of
      patients with AOSD will achieve sustained remission with glucocorticoids
      alone, we generally initiate traditional or biologic DMARD therapy in patients
      requiring prednisone 10 mg daily or more for greater than one month. Our
      long-term goal is complete discontinuation of glucocorticoids, although some
      patients may continue to require up to 5 mg daily. (See 'Subsequent
      therapy: Established disease' below and "Use of glucocorticoids in the
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis" and "Glucocorticoid withdrawal".)


    Anakinra: Efficacy and rationale — Initiating treatment with the IL-1
antagonist anakinra as monotherapy may be effective in AOSD, especially early
in disease, and avoid serious adverse effects that are often associated with the
use of glucocorticoids. Anakinra is a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist
and represents our preferred first-line biologic therapy for AOSD because of its
efficacy, short half-life (six hours), and easy titratability, on the basis primarily of
data accumulated within new-onset sJIA [16,20-22]. (See "Systemic juvenile
idiopathic arthritis: Treatment", section on 'Anakinra' and "Systemic juvenile
idiopathic arthritis: Course, prognosis, and complications".)
---
While not all patients with AOSD respond to anakinra, absence of any reduction
in fever and rash is sufficiently uncommon to justify careful reconsideration of the
diagnosis. Importantly, since anakinra is not typically associated with reactivation
of tuberculosis (TB) infection and exhibits a favorable safety profile as
monotherapy even in serious bacterial infection, if clinically necessary, anakinra
can be part of the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation for AOSD even before
occult infection has been fully excluded [23,24]. By contrast, a response to
glucocorticoids is nonspecific and may complicate the ongoing search for
alternate underlying diagnoses, such as lymphoproliferative malignancy. The
mechanism of action and adverse effects of anakinra and other IL-1 inhibitors are
described in detail separately. (See "Interleukin 1 inhibitors: Biology, principles of
use, and adverse events".)


Much of the support for initiating therapy with anakinra in AOSD has been
extrapolated from the experience in patients with sJIA, in whom a substantial
response to anakinra monotherapy is observed in approximately 70 to 90 percent
of patients; the response to anakinra in AOSD appears comparable [25,26]. (See
"Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment", section on 'Anakinra'.)


Some evidence also indicates that incorporating anakinra into initial therapy could
help to reduce the subsequent development of chronic arthritis, despite the
relatively modest efficacy of anakinra in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults
[12,20]. More extensive investigation is needed to determine whether there is in
fact a "window of opportunity" in sJIA/AOSD during which early effective
intervention might alter the natural history of disease, although this possibility is
now supported by correlative observational and experimental evidence
[12,22,27-29].


    Glucocorticoids: Efficacy and rationale — Glucocorticoids are an
alternative to anakinra and an acceptable first option in patients with AOSD who
remain symptomatic after 7 to 14 days of NSAIDs. Glucocorticoids are rapidly
effective, simple to titrate, and inexpensive. However, we generally prefer
anakinra if available to minimize short- and long-term exposure to
glucocorticoids. (See 'Moderate to severe disease' above and 'Anakinra: Efficacy
and rationale' above.)


Higher initial doses (equivalent to prednisone 0.8 to 1 mg/kg daily) may be
preferable to lower doses when glucocorticoids are used as initial therapy, but
even with higher doses the disease fails to respond completely in many patients,
and effective therapy often requires a prolonged treatment course. This was
illustrated in a retrospective series that compared 40 patients with AOSD treated
with low-dose glucocorticoids (0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg daily) with 40 patients treated
with high-dose glucocorticoids (0.8 to 1 mg/kg daily); the doses used were based
upon the clinical judgment of the treating clinicians [30]. Remission rates after
six months were lower in the low-dose group (25 versus 65 percent), and
glucocorticoid therapy could be discontinued by 18 months in fewer of the
patients treated with low-dose therapy (9 versus 34 percent). These findings are
similar to those of an observational series in sJIA, where conventional
(nonbiologic) treatment was associated with ongoing glucocorticoid therapy six
months after diagnosis in nearly 70 percent of children [31].
---
Additionally, in a study of 45 patients with AOSD, among whom there were 56
trials of glucocorticoid therapy, those with the chronic articular pattern of disease
were less likely to respond than were patients with AOSD with systemic disease
but without chronic articular involvement (7 of 20 [35 percent] versus 28 of 36
[78 percent]) [13].


In patients treated with systemic glucocorticoids, appropriate preventive
measures to minimize impact on bone health and to prevent other adverse
effects of glucocorticoids should be pursued. The prevention of bone loss and the
major side effects of systemic glucocorticoid use are described separately. (See
"Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis" and "Major
adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids".)


Concern for incipient or active MAS — In patients with new-onset AOSD
where incipient or active MAS remains a concern, we typically combine anakinra
with glucocorticoid therapy. Concern for MAS is particularly high in patients with
elevation in ferritin levels out of proportion to other inflammatory markers,
transaminase elevation, marked elevation in D-dimer, thrombocytopenia, and/or
a decreasing erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) despite continued elevation of
C-reactive protein (CRP). In hospitalized patients, we frequently employ anakinra
in high doses (up to 100 mg four times daily, potentially via the intravenous
route [32]) as well as pulse-dose intravenous glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone
1000 mg intravenously daily for one to three days). The clinical manifestations,
diagnosis, and management of MAS are described separately. (See "Clinical
manifestations and diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease", section on
'Macrophage activation syndrome' and "Clinical features and diagnosis of
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", section on 'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'
and "Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis" and
"Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", section on
'MAS/Rheumatologic conditions'.)


SUBSEQUENT THERAPY: ESTABLISHED DISEASE


Treatment approach — The specific drug choices for subsequent management
of adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) after initial treatment of new disease depend
upon the effectiveness and risks of first-line therapies and the range and severity
of disease manifestations.


Treatment decisions are based upon the same general principles as in new-onset
disease (ie, control of inflammation, prevention of end-organ damage, adverse
effects of medications [especially glucocorticoids], and rapid recognition and
intervention for macrophage activation syndrome [MAS]) (see 'Goals of therapy'
above). As with new-onset disease, evidence for specific treatments in AOSD is
principally available as case series, in some cases supplemented by small clinical
trials. Treatment depends upon the prior response to therapy and clinical
features:


   ●  Good response to initial therapy – In patients who respond to initial
      management of AOSD, the key priority is minimization of glucocorticoid
      exposure if present. Achieving discontinuation of glucocorticoids may require
      optimization of dosing, for example, by an adjustment in the dose or
---
      frequency of a biologic agent or the dose or route of administration of
      methotrexate (MTX).


      For patients who have attained complete remission off glucocorticoids,
      including resolution of clinical symptoms and normalization of laboratory
      values, we typically maintain the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug
      (DMARD) regimen for three to six months before we consider drug tapering,
      beginning with the agent of greatest concern with respect to side effects.
      (See 'Medication tapering and duration of therapy' below.)
   ●  Mild systemic and/or articular disease – Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) can provide relief for mild systemic and arthritic features of
      AOSD. Although they are particularly useful in the initial treatment of mild to
      moderate disease, we also use NSAIDs in a limited fashion for several days
      to weeks on an as-needed basis as an antiinflammatory adjunctive therapy
      in patients with established or chronic disease [5,13-16]. The use of NSAIDs
      in AOSD is described in more detail elsewhere in this topic review (see 'Mild
      to moderate disease' above). Patients receiving NSAIDs together with
      glucocorticoids should receive prophylactic therapy for the prevention of
      NSAID gastropathy; prophylaxis should also be considered for all patients on
      chronic NSAIDs after review of individual risk factors. (See "NSAIDs
      (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity".)
   ●  Moderate to severe disease requiring chronic glucocorticoid therapy
      – Patients unable to taper glucocorticoids to ≤10 mg daily of prednisone (or
      equivalent) or who have evidence of joint injury require additional therapy,
      usually with a conventional synthetic DMARD, a biologic DMARD, or both, to
      control disease and limit or prevent adverse effects of chronic glucocorticoid
      therapy. (See 'Glucocorticoid-sparing therapy for chronic management'
      below.)


Glucocorticoid-sparing therapy for chronic management — For patients
unable to reduce glucocorticoids to ≤10 mg daily of prednisone (or equivalent)
we suggest the addition of a glucocorticoid-sparing DMARD rather than
continuing the same level of glucocorticoid therapy. For patients with arthritis,
and patients with evidence of erosive joint disease on joint radiographs, we
prefer methotrexate (MTX); for patients with predominantly systemic symptoms
and/or suspected incipient MAS, we prefer anakinra, an interleukin (IL) 1
inhibitor. (See 'Methotrexate and other conventional DMARDs' below and
'Anakinra' below.)


Alternatives to MTX include leflunomide (LEF), another conventional synthetic
DMARD, and tocilizumab or another IL-6 inhibitor (see 'Methotrexate and other
conventional DMARDs' below and 'Interleukin 6 inhibition' below). We tend to
prefer IL-6 blockade to IL-1 blockade in a patient with AOSD in whom arthritis is
the major clinical feature. By contrast, evidence that high-dose anakinra can be
effective in MAS leads us to prefer IL-1 blockade in patients at high risk for this
complication [20,33], and IL-1 inhibition also remains an option for patients with
arthritis who are resistant to MTX and to an IL-6 inhibitor. Canakinumab, a
longer-acting IL-1 inhibitor than anakinra, may also be effective in some patients
---
with arthritis, and we prefer it over anakinra for chronic therapy in patients with
arthritis who need an IL-1 inhibitor because of its requirement for monthly rather
than daily injection. (See 'Canakinumab and rilonacept' below.)


For patients with arthritis that has not responded to conventional DMARDs (MTX
or LEF) after 8 to 12 weeks, we add an IL-6 inhibitor, or alternatively an IL-1
inhibitor. For those who are refractory to IL-1 and IL-6 blockade, a tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, usually infliximab, may be used, but we restrict its
use to this setting because of the relative inefficacy of TNF blockade for systemic
manifestations of AOSD. (See 'Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors' below.)


For patients with systemic disease who are unable to obtain anakinra or who are
intolerant of daily injections, the IL-1 inhibitor canakinumab (or potentially
rilonacept) is a reasonable alternative, followed by tocilizumab. Sarilumab,
another IL-6 inhibitor, could be considered as a third-line agent as well [34].
(See 'Canakinumab and rilonacept' below and 'Interleukin 6 inhibition' below.)


Therapeutic agents


   Methotrexate and other conventional DMARDs
   ●  Dosing and administration – Methotrexate (MTX) is given on a once-
      weekly basis using the same approach as in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
      We typically initiate MTX at a dose between 10 to 15 mg once weekly for
      most patients, escalating as tolerated after four weeks to 20 to 25 mg
      weekly. Split-dose oral therapy and subcutaneous injection can enhance
      absorption in case of partial responses, as absorption may not be
      commensurate with dose increases in patients receiving ≥15 mg, in some
      cases also helping to overcome gastrointestinal intolerance. Concomitant
      folic acid or folinic acid is also taken, which helps to minimize adverse
      events. (See "Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults" and "Use of
      methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis".)


   ●  Efficacy of methotrexate – Generally regarded as less effective for the
      systemic manifestations of AOSD, including MAS, MTX can help to address
      arthritic manifestations as reflected in its utilization in approximately half of
      patients with AOSD [13,35,36]. Limited data from observational studies
      suggest that MTX is an effective glucocorticoid-sparing agent, enabling
      patients to taper or discontinue glucocorticoids and providing some
      improvement in systemic symptoms [37,38]. The only randomized
      controlled trial of MTX was performed in 45 patients with systemic juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), finding nonsignificant improvement in joint
      features and no change in systemic features, though combined analysis with
      other forms of JIA within the same trial suggested modest improvement in
      arthritis severity [39].
   ●  Alternatives to methotrexate – For patients in whom MTX is poorly
      tolerated or ineffective, other conventional DMARDs may also be employed,
      although data for efficacy remain scant. In our experience, LEF (10 to 20 mg
      daily) can be a helpful adjunct in AOSD patients with arthritis who cannot
      tolerate full-dose MTX or in whom MTX is insufficiently effective [40,41].
---
      Combined MTX/LEF therapy can be effective but requires particular vigilance
      with respect to monitoring for hepatotoxicity [42,43]. The approach to using
      LEF is generally the same as in RA. (See "Pharmacology, dosing, and
      adverse effects of leflunomide in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis" and
      "Alternatives to methotrexate for the initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
      in adults", section on 'Leflunomide'.)


      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and sulfasalazine (SSZ), common DMARDs in RA,
      do not appear to have a routine role in the treatment of AOSD. HCQ therapy
      is often reported in series of AOSD, but to our knowledge, no efficacy data
      are available, and we do not regularly use it for this indication [13,35,36].
      SSZ is anecdotally associated with an unusually high rate of adverse events
      in AOSD, including provocation of MAS, and is typically avoided [6,14].


   Interleukin 1 blockade


       Anakinra — Anakinra is most effective for patients with AOSD when used
as treatment of new-onset disease (see 'Anakinra: Efficacy and rationale' above)
but also shows substantial benefit for chronic disease, as shown best in patients
with sJIA (see "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment" and "Systemic
juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment", section on 'Interleukin 1 inhibitors').
Observational data suggest that the efficacy of anakinra in AOSD is similar to that
in sJIA [25,26]. Case series report utility in AOSD that has been refractory to
treatment with other medications, including glucocorticoids, MTX, other
traditional (nonbiologic) DMARDs, and TNF inhibitors [13,44-49]. Anakinra 100
mg administered by daily subcutaneous injection is the typical dosing for patients
with chronic AOSD, although escalation to twice-daily dosing is necessary in some
patients.


The response to anakinra in patients with AOSD is illustrated by the following
examples:


   ●  In a randomized, open-label trial of 22 patients with AOSD whose disease
      was not responsive to glucocorticoids with or without a traditional DMARD,
      administration of anakinra (100 mg administered subcutaneously daily)
      resulted in remission in 6 of 12 patients, compared with only 2 of 10
      receiving a nonbiologic DMARD (MTX, azathioprine, or LEF) [46]. Three
      patients receiving anakinra, but none receiving DMARDs alone, were able to
      discontinue glucocorticoids.
   ●  A retrospective nationwide French survey identified 28 patients with AOSD
      resistant to NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, and prior DMARDs (including 14 who
      had not responded adequately to biologic agents) who were treated with
      anakinra (100 mg administered by daily subcutaneous injection) alone or
      together with MTX. All patients responded to therapy, and patients were
      able to reduce glucocorticoid doses [49]. After a mean follow-up of 23
      months, 16 patients (57 percent) experienced complete remission, and three
      of these patients could discontinue anakinra. Eight patients (29 percent) had
      a partial response and four patients (14 percent) had a period of complete
      remission but then experienced loss of efficacy. Dose tapering or
      discontinuation was associated with relapse in half of the patients. Two
---
      patients discontinued anakinra because of intensely pruritic rashes at the
      injection site, and two with inadequate responses discontinued the
      medication.


       Canakinumab and rilonacept — The IL-1 inhibitors canakinumab and
rilonacept can be effective in patients with AOSD [25,45,50,51]. Unlike anakinra,
canakinumab (an anti-IL-1 beta monoclonal antibody) is approved for AOSD by
the US Food and Drug Administration, helping to facilitate access, and is
administered by monthly subcutaneous injection. For these reasons, it is
appealing for patients who are unable to obtain anakinra or intolerant of daily
injections [52]. Canakinumab has been employed as the first biologic in some
patients with AOSD, although use as first-line therapy before patients have failed
other treatments has not been reported [50-53].


A randomized trial of canakinumab in 36 patients with AOSD revealed results
consistent with efficacy data in sJIA, although in this small study the formal
endpoint was not met [52]. Canakinumab is dosed at 4 mg/kg, maximum 300
mg, by subcutaneous route every four weeks [52]. Canakinumab can be effective
in patients in whom treatment with anakinra was unsuccessful [50]. Although
supported by fewer data, rilonacept (an IL-1 trap molecule that is a soluble
dimeric fusion protein) may be an alternative for patients in whom both anakinra
and canakinumab have failed [54]. (See "Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis:
Treatment", section on 'Interleukin 1 inhibitors'.)


   Interleukin 6 inhibition — Tocilizumab (a blocking antibody directed at the
IL-6 receptor) is employed in AOSD and sJIA at doses typically higher than those
used in RA. Clinical trials employed doses of 8 mg/kg intravenously every two
weeks [55,56]. In practice, for reasons of convenience, we often begin with
tocilizumab using the subcutaneous route, 162 mg weekly, although intravenous
dosing and dose escalation can be helpful in some patients who fail to respond
fully. A role for IL-6 in sJIA was defined in the 1990s and confirmed through a
randomized trial of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab in 2012, showing
responses both for systemic and arthritic features [55,57,58]. The use and
adverse effects of tocilizumab are described in further detail separately. (See
"Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial conventional
synthetic (nonbiologic) DMARD therapy", section on 'Methotrexate plus IL-6
inhibitor/IL-6 inhibitor monotherapy' and "Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in
adults resistant to initial biologic DMARD therapy", section on 'IL-6 inhibitor
therapies'.)


The benefits of tocilizumab in AOSD have been shown in case series and a small
randomized trial [59-63]. The findings are illustrated by the following reports:
   ●  The efficacy and safety of tocilizumab were examined in a randomized trial
      in Japan involving 27 patients with active AOSD refractory to glucocorticoids
      (≥0.5 mg/kg daily of prednisolone or equivalent given for more than two
      weeks) who were randomly assigned to also receive either tocilizumab (8
      mg/kg intravenously every two weeks) or placebo [59]. A higher proportion
      of patients achieved an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response
      criteria for 50 percent improvement in disease activity (ACR50) response at
---
      week 4, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (61.5
      percent, 95% CI 31.6-86.1 versus 30.8 percent, 95% CI 9.1-61.4, p =
      0.24). At 12 weeks, patients receiving tocilizumab had greater reductions in
      systemic features of AOSD based upon the systemic features scoring tool
      used in the study (least square means for change -4.1 versus -2.3, p =
      0.003) and greater reductions in glucocorticoid dose (46.2 versus 21.0
      percent reduction compared with baseline, p = 0.017).


      No serious adverse events were noted in the 12-week blinded portion of the
      trial; serious adverse effects seen with tocilizumab during the 40-week
      open-label extension included infections, aseptic necrosis in the hips,
      exacerbation of the AOSD, drug eruption, and anaphylactic shock, but there
      were no deaths or episodes of MAS. Limitations of the trial included its small
      size and some imbalances in baseline characteristics of treatment and
      control groups.


   ●  The benefits of IL-6 inhibition were described in a multicenter, open-label,
      retrospective study of 34 patients with AOSD treated with tocilizumab
      (usually 8 mg/kg administered intravenously every four weeks [22 of 34
      patients] or every two weeks [10 of 34 patients]); all patients had failed
      treatment with glucocorticoids and at least one traditional DMARD (typically
      MTX), and 50 percent had also received a biologic DMARD, typically a TNF
      inhibitor or anakinra [61]. Acute phase reactants and systemic
      manifestations typically improved in the first month of tocilizumab therapy,
      while the frequency of joint manifestations (arthralgia and/or arthritis)
      decreased modestly during that interval (from 97 to 68 percent). After one
      year, the frequency of joint manifestations was reduced to 32 percent. Other
      findings improved to a greater degree and responses were sustained at one
      year. Decreases were seen in the frequency of cutaneous manifestations and
      fever (both from 59 to 6 percent), in lymphadenopathy (from 29 percent to
      none), and in acute phase reactants. The median dose of prednisone was
      reduced from 14 to 2.5 mg daily.


      Treatment was permanently discontinued in two patients, both with severe
      infections (one with pyelonephritis and acute enterocolitis and the other with
      spondylodiscitis and a psoas abscess due to Staphylococcus aureus).
      Additional, more common adverse effects, none of which required
      permanent discontinuation of the drug, included other infections (eight
      cases, including one patient with herpes zoster), mild leukopenia or
      neutropenia (four patients), and elevated liver enzymes (four patients).


The correlation of elevated IL-6 with arthritic presentation in both sJIA and AOSD
has raised the possibility that tocilizumab may be superior to IL-1 blockade in
patients with primarily arthritic manifestations [56,64]. Some evidence supports
this possibility. A retrospective series of 27 patients found that systemic
symptoms in the absence of arthritis predicted good response to IL-1 blockade
while an arthritis-dominant phenotype was associated with response to IL-6
blockade [65]. However, no comparable results were identified in a 140-patient
series of patients with AOSD treated with IL-1 blockade, and separate trials
report similar levels of efficacy of canakinumab and tocilizumab against arthritis
---
in sJIA, although these agents have not been directly compared [50,55,66].


Due to an enhanced risk of gastrointestinal perforation reported with tocilizumab,
we avoid IL-6 blockade in patients with known diverticulosis [67].


   Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors — In patients for whom a TNF inhibitor is
appropriate, we typically begin with infliximab because the infused route enables
maximal dosing, since in our experience patients with AOSD often require high-
dose therapy (eg, infliximab 10 mg/kg monthly).


Benefit for patients with AOSD has been reported with etanercept [45,68,69],
infliximab [45,69-73], and adalimumab [13,45,74], usually in patients who have
experienced an inadequate response to glucocorticoids and MTX. These benefits
predominantly affect arthritic features; fever and rash respond inconsistently,
and TNF inhibition is not effective for MAS.


The following data illustrate the range of findings:


   ●  Among 12 patients with AOSD resistant to prior DMARD therapy, 7 achieved
      ACR20 improvement after six months of treatment with etanercept [68]. In
      three patients with fever and rash at disease entry, only one demonstrated
      improvement in these disease manifestations.
   ●  Six patients treated with infliximab experienced resolution of their fever,
      rash, hepatosplenomegaly, arthralgia, and myalgia after the first series of
      infusions [72]. Glucocorticoid doses were reduced during the follow-up
      period of 5 to 28 months suggesting that infliximab had been effective.
      Similar benefits with infliximab were noted in a second study [73].


Case reports and small series indicate that treatment failure, partial response,
and loss of efficacy over time are not uncommon [69,75]. This was illustrated in
a series of 20 patients with disease refractory to MTX who were treated with
etanercept (10 patients), infliximab (15 patients), or both agents sequentially (5
patients) [69]. The following results were noted:


   ●  Complete remissions were observed in 5 patients (1 with etanercept, 4 with
      infliximab).
   ●  Partial responses were observed in 11 patients (6 with etanercept, 5 with
      infliximab).
   ●  Despite these initial benefits, 17 patients (85 percent) ultimately
      discontinued treatment with the TNF inhibitor, most often for loss of efficacy
      (11 patients).


The potential adverse effects of TNF inhibitors in AOSD, which are described in
detail separately, are the same as those in patients with RA. (See "Tumor
necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: An overview of adverse effects".)


REFRACTORY TO STANDARD THERAPIES — For patients with adult-onset
Still's disease (AOSD) who fail to respond to well-established therapies, several
alternate options can be considered:


   ●  Janus kinase inhibitors — We employ Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in
      patients with AOSD for whom conventional nonbiologic and biologic
---
   treatments have proven insufficient to enable symptom control with no more
   glucocorticoids than prednisone 5 mg daily or equivalent. The JAK proteins
   mediate intracellular signaling downstream of multiple cytokines and growth
   factors, including interleukin (IL) 6 and interferons. Limited data suggest
   that agents in the class may be useful for patients with systemic juvenile
   idiopathic arthritis (sJIA)/AOSD [76-78].


   In the largest series published, 14 patients with AOSD refractory to
   prednisone and at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)
   were treated with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, resulting in remission in seven
   and partial response in six, as well as a marked reduction of glucocorticoid
   requirement [79]. Since interferon gamma appears to play a key pathogenic
   role in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), JAK inhibitors may be
   particularly appealing for AOSD patients with a history of MAS. The use,
   dosing, and adverse effects of JAK inhibitors are described in further detail
   separately. (See "Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to
   initial conventional synthetic (nonbiologic) DMARD therapy", section on 'JAK
   inhibitor therapy' and "Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant
   to initial biologic DMARD therapy", section on 'JAK inhibitors' and "Treatment
   and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis" and "Overview of the
   Janus kinase inhibitors for rheumatologic and other inflammatory
   disorders".)
●  Other agents


    •  Cyclosporine – Some evidence suggests that cyclosporine is effective in
       AOSD [7,13,80-83]. We prefer other agents because of the risks
       associated with cyclosporine use, including nephrotoxicity. The calcineurin
       inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are options for treatment of MAS.
       (See "Pharmacology of calcineurin inhibitors" and "Cyclosporine and
       tacrolimus nephrotoxicity" and "Treatment and prognosis of
       hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis".)
    •  Thalidomide – Thalidomide is effective in some patients with sJIA [84,85].
       One report identified efficacy in a case of AOSD [86]. Teratogenicity,
       neuropathy, and cost represent barriers to use, but thalidomide could be
       considered in carefully selected patients with refractory AOSD.
    •  Rituximab – Limited data suggest that rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal
       antibody that depletes peripheral B cells for 6 to 12 months or longer,
       may be of benefit for the treatment of AOSD that is refractory to other
       biologic agents [87]. It was reported as effective in AOSD complicated by
       thrombotic microangiopathy [88]. It is widely used for the treatment of
       rheumatoid arthritis (RA). (See "Rituximab: Principles of use and adverse
       effects in rheumatoid arthritis".)


    •  Intravenous immune globulin – Intravenous immune globulin has been
       administered to patients with AOSD, with sustained benefit reported in
       some patients, particularly in the context of MAS [89-93]. (See "Overview
       of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy".)
---
       •  Tadekinig alfa – A recombinant IL-18 binding protein, tadekinig alfa is an
          investigational agent that has shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in
          some patients with AOSD [94]. This agent is not yet commercially
          available.


       •  Cyclophosphamide - Cyclophosphamide has been employed successfully
          in AOSD at the case-report level, including in patients with MAS [93,95].
       •  Combination biologic therapy – This approach is typically avoided because
          of concerns over synergistic immunosuppression; combination biologics
          have been employed for some patients with refractory sJIA/AOSD,
          including anakinra with abatacept and anakinra with the JAK inhibitor
          baricitinib [77,96].
       •  Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation – Bone marrow transplantation
          (allogeneic) has been reported as effective in some patients with
          refractory sJIA [97,98]. Autologous transplantation has also been
          reported [97,99,100]. Treatment-related morbidity and mortality remain
          an important concern for this approach.


MONITORING


Disease and drug monitoring — Monitoring of the response to therapy
includes assessment at regular intervals of the clinical and laboratory response as
well as for adverse effects of medications. Patients with new-onset and
exacerbations ("flares") of adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) generally need to be
seen at least every two to four weeks depending upon treatment and clinical
status.


Patients on a stable medical regimen who are doing well clinically are generally
seen every three to four months. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic monitoring of
disease activity and joint injury is otherwise similar to that performed in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). (See "General principles and overview of
management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults", section on 'Assessment and
monitoring' and "General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid
arthritis in adults", section on 'Clinical assessment of disease and related
testing'.)


Particular attention is given to the following:


   ●  Medical history – Patients should be asked about fever, rash, new joint
      swelling, sore throat, and other symptoms that had characterized the
      patient's illness when disease was active.
   ●  Laboratory testing – We obtain blood for a complete blood count (CBC),
      blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, electrolytes, ferritin, D-dimer, and
      alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST; and additional liver
      function studies if abnormalities are seen).


      Given reports of hepatotoxicity attributed to anakinra, we monitor liver
      enzymes within two weeks after starting this medication and every two to
      four months thereafter [101,102].
---
      Additional monitoring with most of these studies for macrophage activation
      syndrome (MAS) is also indicated in patients starting a new medication.
      (See 'Monitoring for MAS' below.)
   ●  Monitoring for complications of AOSD – Certain conditions may occur as
      complications during the course of treatment of AOSD. These include MAS
      and possibly an AOSD-associated lung disease similar to a condition found in
      some patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). We closely
      monitor for MAS during the early stages of treatment with the introduction
      of any agent and continue to have a low threshold for considering MAS in
      any patient with AOSD. (See 'Monitoring for MAS' below and 'Monitoring for
      lung disease' below.)


Information regarding the adverse effects of medications in AOSD is derived from
case reports, small case series, and a very small number of randomized trials, as
well as extrapolation from sJIA.


Monitoring for MAS — Regular monitoring for MAS is prudent when initiating
any new treatment for AOSD with active systemic features since MAS is a leading
cause of death in patients with AOSD [103]. MAS can occur at any time, even
when a patient's disease is well controlled on biologic therapies, and can occur
without an obvious trigger [104]. There are no data, other than the infrequent
reports of MAS associated with certain drug therapies, to indicate any special or
novel concerns regarding the agents used in the treatment of AOSD. However, in
patients receiving interleukin (IL) 1 or IL-6 blockade, MAS may initially present
with attenuated clinical and laboratory features [105].


A high degree of suspicion should be maintained as clinical features of MAS may
strongly resemble features of AOSD. The appearance of MAS in patients with
AOSD is typically heralded by a recurrence of systemic symptoms, including fever
and rash, although this is not invariably the case. The physical examination may
reveal lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly.


In patients starting a new medication for AOSD, including nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we obtain the following laboratory studies
every two weeks initially and with any escalation of the dose:


   ●  CBC, differential white count, and platelet count
   ●  AST and ALT
   ●  Ferritin
   ●  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)
   ●  D-dimer


The most specific routine laboratory finding is ferritin, which frequently rises to
levels >5000 ng/L, although concomitant therapy with tocilizumab and, to a
lesser extent, IL-1 blockers can blunt this rise [105]. CRP rises as a reflection of
inflammation, though the ESR may fall paradoxically through fibrinogen
consumption, leading to a marked increase in the ratio between ferritin and ESR
[106]. D-dimer reflects intravascular coagulation; commonly elevated in active
sJIA/AOSD, a marked increase is typically seen in MAS. Additional changes in
routine laboratory studies include leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and
---
increases in hepatic transaminases [10].


The frequency of testing can be decreased to monthly if the dose is stable and if
the aminotransferases remain within the normal range. Testing can be decreased
to every three months after the liver function studies have remained normal for
at least three months on a stable drug regimen.


Patients suspected of MAS should be immediately referred for consultation with a
rheumatologist or hematologist with expertise in hemophagocytic syndromes
associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. (See "Clinical
manifestations and diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease", section on
'Macrophage activation syndrome' and "Clinical features and diagnosis of
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", section on 'Triggers' and "Clinical features
and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", section on 'Rheumatologic
disorders/MAS'.)


Monitoring for lung disease — Clinicians should be attentive to a novel and
potentially serious pulmonary complication of sJIA, and possible AOSD, described
since the early 2000s in case reports and case series; in sJIA, this has been
termed sJIA-lung disease (sJIA-LD) [107-109]. Lung disease in patients with
AOSD was reported in one series in 18 of 147 patients, in whom it was associated
with higher mortality, typically from refractory MAS rather than the lung disease
itself; whether these cases correspond to sJIA-LD is unclear [110]. However,
clinicians caring for patients with AOSD, especially those receiving IL-1 or IL-6
inhibitors, should be aware of this association, although risk in patients with
AOSD is not fully defined [111].


In sJIA this syndrome has been found most commonly in patients whose disease
begins at a young age (many under two years) and who have a history of
episodes of MAS; laboratory correlates include elevation of IL-18 and, in many
patients, a striking eosinophilia [108,109]. Further clinical associations include
trisomy 21, erythematous clubbing of the digits, and, in 30 percent, a history of
anaphylactic-type reactions to infused tocilizumab [109]. Most but not all affected
children have received IL-1 inhibitors and often also IL-6 inhibitors, raising the
possibility that sJIA-LD could represent a complication of therapy or, alternately,
of reduced use of glucocorticoids and methotrexate (MTX) [109,111].


MEDICATION TAPERING AND DURATION OF THERAPY — A substantial
portion of patients with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) are ultimately able to
come entirely off therapy, unlike patients with other chronic inflammatory
rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (see "Clinical
manifestations and diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease"). Some of these
patients may have been destined to experience a "monocyclic" form of AOSD
(analogous to monocyclic systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [sJIA]). It is
possible that aggressive therapy given during a "window of opportunity" in early
disease may favorably impact the disease course [12,16,20]. Protocols for
tapering and discontinuation of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
in AOSD are not available.


For patients in complete remission for at least three months, we gradually taper
medications with the goal of drug discontinuation. Conventional synthetic
---
DMARDs such as methotrexate (MTX) are typically weaned by a gradual reduction
of the dose by 2.5 to 5 mg every two to three months, whereas for biologic
agents, extending the interval between doses may be modestly preferable
[16,112,113].


As examples, we take the following approach to tapering of biologic DMARDs
based upon our clinical experience and that of other experts:
    ●  Anakinra – We wean anakinra to every other day for one month followed by
       discontinuation, cautioning patients to keep 7 to 14 doses of anakinra on
       hand to allow immediate resumption of treatment if disease recurs [16].


    ●  Canakinumab – For canakinumab, we increase the interval from monthly to
       every other month for two infusions and then to every three months for two
       infusions before discontinuing [112].
    ●  Tocilizumab – For tocilizumab, we space injections from weekly to every
       other week for two months and then to monthly for two months before
       discontinuing; infusions are spaced to monthly and then every other month
       (two infusions at each step) before ending therapy.


In patients in whom disease recurs, we return to full-intensity therapy to regain
control before tapering again to the lowest tolerated dose or dose frequency.


TREATMENT OF RELAPSE — The treatment of choice in a patient who relapses
while on therapy or after discontinuation of treatment depends upon the
symptoms and findings, including the extent and severity of organ system
involvement, as well as the intensity of the inflammatory response:


    ●  Flare during tapering – Increasing medication doses to the level
       previously effective may be adequate in patients who flare during the
       tapering of medications. (See 'Medication tapering and duration of therapy'
       above and 'Subsequent therapy: Established disease' above.)
    ●  Mild symptoms – In general, mild symptoms can be addressed using
       nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDs). (See 'Mild to moderate
       disease' above and 'Treatment approach' above.)
    ●  Systemic symptoms – Systemic symptoms such as fever and rash require
       biologic therapy and/or glucocorticoids, with careful monitoring for incipient
       macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). (See 'Monitoring for MAS' above.)


    ●  Arthritis – Arthritis can be addressed by conventional disease-modifying
       antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate (MTX) or leflunomide
       (LEF), or by institution or change in biologic therapy (favoring interleukin
       [IL] 6 blockade). Incipient or active MAS requires glucocorticoids, often
       together with IL-1 blockade or other agents. In patients who flare during the
       tapering of medications, increasing medication doses to the level previously
       effective may be adequate. (See 'Initial therapy: New-onset disease' above
       and 'Subsequent therapy: Established disease' above.)


    ●  Severe disease – In patients with severe relapses or with the new
       development of life-threatening disease manifestations, a modification of
---
      therapy to incorporate an approach similar to that used for initial severe
      disease may be required, depending upon the specific medications to which
      the patient has previously responded or with which they are being treated at
      the time of the clinical change. (See 'Initial therapy: New-onset disease'
      above and 'Subsequent therapy: Established disease' above.)


PROGNOSIS — The functional status of patients with adult-onset Still's disease
(AOSD) is often good, even in the setting of a chronic disease pattern. Several
predictors of chronic disease and of an unfavorable outcome have been described
in AOSD [14,114,115]:


   ●  Development of an erosive polyarthritis during the initial presenting episode
      of disease
   ●  Involvement of the shoulders or hips
   ●  A history of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)
   ●  A history of cardiac involvement, including pericarditis


Prior to routine use of biologics, the need for more than two years of systemic
glucocorticoid therapy was also a poor prognostic factor.


In one series published in 1991 of 62 patients with AOSD, 36 percent had a
chronic disease course, but 90 percent were judged to be American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) Functional Class 1 (able to perform usual activities of daily
living, including self-care, vocational, and avocational activities) [14,116]. In
findings published in 1987, polyarticular onset and chronic joint involvement were
associated with a poorer functional outcome, but systemic symptoms were not;
joint arthroplasty significantly improved the functional status of AOSD patients
with chronic destructive arthritis [15]. These observations were made prior the
standard use of biologic agents in this condition. No prospective long-term
studies of patients with AOSD receiving early biologic therapy are available.


Chronic active inflammation resistant to treatment can lead to AA (secondary)
amyloidosis [117-119]. Use of anti-interleukin (IL) 1 therapies may prevent
progression of amyloid but may not treat extant disease [120]. (See "Causes and
diagnosis of AA amyloidosis and relation to rheumatic diseases".)

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
   ●  New-onset adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD)
       •  Mild disease – For patients with mild disease, such as fevers, rash,
          arthralgias, or mild arthritis, and in the absence of macrophage activation
          syndrome (MAS), we suggest initial therapy with antiinflammatory doses
          of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) rather than
          glucocorticoids or conventional or biologic disease-modifying
          antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Grade 2C). An antiinflammatory dose
          and regimen should be used (eg, naproxen [500 mg twice daily],
          ibuprofen [800 mg three times daily]). (See 'Approach to initial therapy'
---
       above and 'Mild to moderate disease' above.)
    •  Moderate to severe disease – For patients with moderate to severe
       AOSD, which may include serositis, debilitating arthritis, fevers refractory
       to NSAIDs, or internal organ involvement, and for patients in whom two
       weeks of NSAIDs are insufficient, we suggest anakinra rather than either
       NSAIDs alone, glucocorticoids, or another DMARD (Grade 2C). Our usual
       initial dose is 100 mg subcutaneously daily. Glucocorticoids (20 to 60 mg
       orally daily, depending upon the severity of disease and the initial
       response) are a reasonable alternative if anakinra is unavailable. (See
       'Approach to initial therapy' above and 'Moderate to severe disease'
       above.)
    •  Concern for MAS – For patients in whom incipient or active MAS
       remains a concern, we suggest combining anakinra with glucocorticoid
       therapy, rather than using a single agent (Grade 2C). (See 'Concern for
       incipient or active MAS' above.)
●  Management of established disease
    •  Glucocorticoid-sparing therapy – For patients unable to reduce
       glucocorticoids to ≤10 mg daily of prednisone (or equivalent) after one
       month of therapy, we suggest the addition of a glucocorticoid-sparing
       DMARD rather than continuing the same level of glucocorticoid therapy
       (Grade 2C). (See 'Treatment approach' above and 'Glucocorticoid-
       sparing therapy for chronic management' above.).


         -  For patients with arthritis (including any evidence of erosive joint
            disease on joint radiographs), we prefer methotrexate (MTX).
            Alternatives to MTX include leflunomide (LEF) and tocilizumab or
            other interleukin (IL) 6 inhibitor. (See 'Methotrexate and other
            conventional DMARDs' above and 'Interleukin 6 inhibition' above.)


         -  For patients with arthritis that has not responded to conventional
            DMARDs (MTX or LEF) and who are also refractory to IL-1 and IL-6
            inhibition, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor may be used; we
            limit its use in AOSD to refractory arthritis. (See 'Tumor necrosis
            factor inhibitors' above.)


         -  For patients with predominantly systemic symptoms and/or
            suspected incipient MAS, we prefer anakinra, an IL-1 inhibitor.
            Canakinumab is a reasonable alternative to anakinra. (See 'Anakinra'
            above.)


    •  Monitoring – Monitoring of the response to therapy includes assessment
       at regular intervals of the clinical and laboratory response as well as for
       adverse effects of medications. Usual laboratory monitoring includes a
       complete blood count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen and creatinine,
       electrolytes, ferritin, D-dimer, and alanine and aspartate
       aminotransferases (ALT, AST). (See 'Disease and drug monitoring' above
       and 'Monitoring for MAS' above.)
---
       •  Duration of therapy – For patients in complete remission for at least
          three months, we gradually taper medications with the goal of drug
          discontinuation. (See 'Medication tapering and duration of therapy'
          above.)


       •  Treatment of relapse – Treatment for patients who relapse while on
          therapy or after discontinuation of treatment depends upon the
          symptoms and findings, including the extent and severity of organ
          system involvement, as well as the intensity of the inflammatory
          response. Increasing medication doses to the level previously effective
          may be adequate in patients who flare during the tapering of
          medications. (See 'Treatment of relapse' above.)
